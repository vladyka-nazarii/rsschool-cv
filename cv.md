### Summary

I've always been interested in computers and how they work. Even when I was studying in university for economist, I set up a small ISP in a hostel and was CEO and CTO. After graduating from university, I went to work as a CEO of a larger provider located in Odesa. I've always wanted to know how telecommunication equipment works and how it can be improved, so I chose programming as one of the way to achieve this goal. And then I realized that I could do anything and I could not stop
